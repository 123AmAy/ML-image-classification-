# Image Classification using Neural Networks

This project is an image classification model built using deep learning techniques.  
It classifies images of cats and dogs using a deep neural network 

to optimize the accuracy on the test set i have used the L2 regularization.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Cats and Dogs dataset from Kaggle:
